A tutorial project for practicing UI writing with code (without storyboards) using UIKit.

The project implements one screenâ€”an example of a donation screen. It dynamically selects the donation amount, which is passed to a variable and displayed in the console when a button is clicked (you can connect to a payment system and pass this value there).
